//! Window layout logic.
//!
//! Niri implements scrollable tiling with dynamic workspaces. The scrollable tiling is mostly
//! orthogonal to any particular workspace system, though outputs living in separate coordinate
//! spaces suggest per-output workspaces.
//!
//! I chose a dynamic workspace system because I think it works very well. In particular, it works
//! naturally across outputs getting added and removed, since workspaces can move between outputs
//! as necessary.
//!
//! In the layout, one output (the first one to be added) is designated as *primary*. This is where
//! workspaces from disconnected outputs will move. Currently, the primary output has no other
//! distinction from other outputs.
//!
//! Where possible, niri tries to follow these principles with regards to outputs:
//!
//! 1. Disconnecting and reconnecting the same output must not change the layout.
//!    * This includes both secondary outputs and the primary output.
//! 2. Connecting an output must not change the layout for any workspaces that were never on that
//!    output.
//!
//! Therefore, we implement the following logic: every workspace keeps track of which output it
//! originated on—its *original output*. When an output disconnects, its workspaces are appended to
//! the (potentially new) primary output, but remember their original output. Then, if the original
//! output connects again, all workspaces originally from there move back to that output.
//!
//! In order to avoid surprising behavior, if the user creates or moves any new windows onto a
//! workspace, it forgets its original output, and its current output becomes its original output.
//! Imagine a scenario: the user works with a laptop and a monitor at home, then takes their laptop
//! with them, disconnecting the monitor, and keeps working as normal, using the second monitor's
//! workspace just like any other. Then they come back, reconnect the second monitor, and now we
//! don't want an unassuming workspace to end up on it.
